<h1 class = center>Tony Chen</h1>
<p class = "center">Chess DX</p>
<p> This is a game I recently started making. It mostly functions like a normal Chess game but with a couple modifications as shown in the youtube video</p>
<p> How it works:</p>
<p> You start with 15HP and the first person to have a HP of 0 or a lower HP at turn 50 loses </p>
<p> Checks deal 1DMG, Checkmates deal 3 DMG, the rat deals 5 DMG</p>
<p> If a piece is protected by another piece, your king is not able to take it</p>
