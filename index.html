<h2 class = center>Chess DX</h2>
<p> This is a game I recently started coding in December 2022 but I had the concept of back in August 2022. It mostly functions like a normal Chess game but with a couple modifications as shown in the youtube video. I changed the game from the version shown in the video due to the original being over Github's 100MB limit.</p>

<p> How it works:</p>
<p> -You start with 15HP and the first person to have a HP of 0 or a lower HP at turn 50 loses </p>
<p> -Checks deal 1 DMG, Checkmates deal 3 DMG, the rat deals 5 DMG</p>
<p> -If a piece is protected by another piece, your king is not able to take it</p>

<p>I have mostly been posting my art on Discord. I took a few of my my better drawings and stuff I did for work/volunteering and put them here on DeviantArt to make it more accessible.</p>
